        <h2>LeBron James</h2>
        <img src="images/labron.jpg">
        <br>
        Lebron James, even at his age now, is still one of <br> the fastest in the NBA and is well known for <br>his incredible strength and agility. He is the <br> only player in NBA History to be Top 100 for <br>points, assissts, rebounds, blocks, three <br>pointers, and steals. He is an 18 NBA All-Star, <br>and has competed in 10 NBA Finals contests, <br>although he would only win 4 titles. This <br>glaring flaw is the difference maker between <br>him and the greatest NBA Player of all time.

<h2>Michael Jordan</h2>
<img src="images/goat.jpg">
<br>
Jordan is widely regarded as the greatest basketball player<br> of all time -- he changed so many different <br>facets of the league -- but maybe most of all, he <br>showed players they could grow themselves into a global <br> brand on and off the floor with stellar play and the <br>right marketing machine behind it all. Jordan <br>revolutionized the way players could expand their <br>corporate portfolios -- and dominate well after their <br>playing careers end. Oh yeah: Along the way, he was a <br>six-time NBA Finals champ, six-time NBA Finals MVP, <br>five-time NBA MVP and 14-time NBA All-Star.
