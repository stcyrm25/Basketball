    There are many teams throughout NBA History which make a great argument for "Greatest Team of All Time". This includes (from worst to best):
    <li>2014-15 Golden State Warriors</li>
    <li>1996-97 Chicago Bulls</li>
    <li>2000-01 Los Angeles Lakers</li>
    <li>1986-87 Los Angeles Lakers</li>
    <li>1990-91 Chicago Bulls</li>
    <li>1985-86 Boston Celtics</li>
    <li>1971-72 Los Angeles Lakers</li>
    <li>1970-71 Milwaukee Bucks</li>
    <li>1995-96 Chicago Bulls</li>
  
<br>
Although these teams are great, there is one that has not been mentioned yet that is in fact, the greatest of all time.

<h2>2016-17 Golden State Warriors</h2>

<br>
The Golden State Warriors are regarded as the greatest NBA <br>team of all time. They would win 67 games, with their <br>most valuable player, Kevin Durant (KD) injured for 20 <br>games. Only 13 NBA teams have ever won 67 or more games <br> in an NBA season and only 9 would then after win the <br>title, something that the Warriors did easily, only <br>notching one postseason loss in a total of 17 games.
